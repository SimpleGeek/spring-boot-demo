# Spring Boot Demo

A simple Spring Boot application to demonstrate techniques and
project structuring standards.  This application is configured as
a Eureka discovery server client, so you'll need to have a Eureka
discovery server [like this one](https://github.com/SimpleGeek/simple-discovery-server)
running on port 8761.
